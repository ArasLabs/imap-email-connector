# E-mail Connector

The Aras Innovator E-mail Connector is an open solution to transfer e-mails from any e-mail client supporting the IMAP protocol to the Aras Innovator server.

The E-mail Connector contains two main components. The first component is the IMAP server. This server acts as a gateway between the e-mail clients and the Aras Innovator server. For the connection between your e-mail account and the IMAP server, you just use the IMAP server as an incoming e-mail server.

The Aras Innovator E-mail Connector is also available in an enterprise, commercial version. The enterprise version includes a new e-mail management assistant that makes mass processing and distribution of permissions possible, so even largest quantities of e-mails will be assigned quickly and comfortably to persons and objects. For more information about the enterprise version, please visit the DataSquare website at [http://www.datasquare.de/en/portfolio/plm/aras_e-mail_connector.php](http://www.datasquare.de/en/portfolio/plm/aras_e-mail_connector.php).
